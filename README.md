# plasma-yamaha

This is a simple plasma applet for KDE Plasma 5. You can control power and volume of yamava av recievers.
Since not many using the applet right now some of the options, input selection and speaker settings, are hard coded in the source code.
Mail me if you need some help configuring it.

## Installation

plasmapkg2  -i *directory*
